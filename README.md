# Flight Status and Notifications System

## Overview

This project provides a real-time flight status update and notification system. It includes a React.js frontend, a Python Flask backend, and uses MongoDB for data storage and Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python 3**: [Install Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **MongoDB**: [Install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- **Firebase Account**: [Create a Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-status-notifications.git
cd flight-status-notifications
```

### 2. Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure `requirements.txt` contains the following:

   ```
   Flask
   pymongo
   pyfcm
   flask-cors
   ```

4. **Configure Firebase**

   - Obtain your Firebase Server Key from the Firebase Console.
   - Replace `YOUR_SERVER_KEY` in `app.py` with your actual Firebase Server Key.

5. **Start MongoDB**

   Ensure MongoDB is running on the default port (27017). You can start MongoDB with:

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

6. **Run the Flask Server**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The Flask server will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

7. **Import Test Data**

   Run the following script to insert sample data into MongoDB:

   ```bash
   python import_data.py
   ```

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the React Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React application will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Verify the Setup

1. **Check the Backend**

   Visit `http://localhost:5000/api/flights` to ensure the Flask API is returning flight data.

2. **Check the Frontend**

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the React application displaying flight data.

### Troubleshooting

- **Network Errors**: Ensure that CORS is configured correctly in `app.py` and that the proxy is set up in `frontend/package.json`.
- **Database Issues**: Ensure MongoDB is running and that the data is correctly inserted.
- **Firebase Issues**: Verify that the Firebase Server Key is correct and that Firebase Cloud Messaging is properly set up.

### Additional Notes

- Modify the `app.py` file to change the API endpoints or adjust the notification logic as needed.
- Customize the React frontend by editing components in the `src` directory.
